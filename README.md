# UC San Diego/Coursera MOOC starter code

This is a skeleton to use Unfolding in Eclipse as well as some starter
code for the Object Oriented Programming in Java course offered by 
UC San Diego through Coursera.


### Installation

Import this folder in Eclipse ('File' -> 'Import' -> 'Existing Projects into
Workspace', Select this folder, 'Finish')


### Manual Install

If the import does not work follow the steps below.

- Create new Java project
- Copy+Paste all files into project
- Add all lib/*.jars to build path
- Set native library location for jogl.jar. Choose appropriate folder for your OS.
- Add data/ as src


### Troubleshooting

Switch Java Compiler to 1.8 if you get VM problems. (Processing should work with Java 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8)

I used `jdk1.8.0_261` along with its JRE to compile and work through all the projects and assignments.
